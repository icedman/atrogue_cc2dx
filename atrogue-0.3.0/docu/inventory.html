<p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The <b>inventory</b> is a list of all the objects you are currently carrying
in your <b>pack</b>. It can contain the objects you had when you entered the
dungeon as well as any object you picked up somewhere during the game. You can
read the complete inventory with the <a href="key.html">keyboard command</a>
"i". You can read special, partial inventories with "I", or e.g. with a dungeon
map symbol like "/" for a list of wands. If you have enabled color support,
some objects are listed in certain colors: armor in green, weapons in yellow
and magic objects in blue color. Inventories are provided as <a
href="key.html#st">scrollable texts</a>.</p>

<p>When you keep picking objects while moving around, you become slower and
your pack finally gets "full"; at this point, you have to decide whether you
leave an object lying on the ground or rather drop one or more objects from
your pack and pick the other; to pick a "heavy" object, you may have to drop
several "light" objects.</p>

<p>All objects have a limited lifetime. If you use them intensively or carry
them around for a long time, they might fall to pieces - and magic objects
might lose their charges.</p>

<p><a name="example"></a><b>An Inventory Example</b></p>

<p>When you just entered the dungeon, your inventory might look like this:</p>
<!-- <p><hr width="40%" align="left"></p> -->
<p><pre>Complete Inventory

] (a) ring mail (+1; d=3; being worn)
) (b) a mace (+2; d=7; in hand)
) (c) a bow (+0; d=1)
) (d) 25 arrows (+1; d=3)</pre></p>

<!-- <p><hr width="40%" align="left"></p> -->

<p>Each inventory line shows one object and consists of</p>

<p><ul>
<li>a character representing the class of the object (the same characters are
used in the <a href="map_screen.html">dungeon map</a>);</li>
<li>a lowercase letter which you enter when you are asked for an object;</li>
<li>a short description; the amount of information depends on how much you
already have discovered about that kind of objects and the object itself. To
find out more about an object (especially about <i>magic</i> objects), you can
try to find a <i>scroll of identify</i> somewhere in the dungeon and read it
with the <a href="key.html">keyboard command</a> "r".
</ul></p>

<p>The information in parentheses means:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>the <b>enchantment</b> of the object, e.g. "+1" (the object is enchanted,
and the extent of enchantment is 1), "1" (the extent of enchantment is 1, but
you don't know whether it's enchanted or cursed), "ench" (the object is
enchanted or neutral) or "curs" (the object is cursed);</li>
<li>how much <b>damage</b> the object might hold off you when you're hit
(armor, being worn), or how much damage the object might do to other creatures
when you wield or throw it (other object kinds), e.g. "d=3";</li>
<li>the <b>number of charges</b> of a wand, staff, rod or scroll; that roughly
says how often you can use the magic power of the object yet, e.g. "c=2".</li>
<li>additional information about whether you currently wear the piece of armor,
wield the weapon, have put the ring on hand etc.</li>
<li>for magic objects: maybe also the kind of the object (if you identified it;
e.g. <i>sleep</i> for a wand of sleep) and how you called it (if you used the
<a href="key.html">keyboard command</a> combination "X"-"C").</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="selection"></a><b>Object Selection</b></p>

<p>For some <a href="key.html">keyboard commands</a>, you have to provide
additional information. For example, when you use the command "t" to throw an
object, you are asked "throw what?". At this point, you can directly enter a
lowercase letter for the object you want to throw.</p>

<p>If you don't remember the letter, you can instead press "&gt;" in order to
view a list of all inventory entries which can be used with the given command;
press "&lt;" instead for a list which is sorted by object classes. - For
throwing, objects of any class are allowed; for reading, only scrolls are
allowed; etc. If only certain classes are allowed, the question is followed by
a list of characters representing the allowed classes in quotation marks.
Example: <i>zap with what? "/"</i></p>

<p>If you know in advance that you want to select an object of a certain class,
you can enter the character which represents that class of objects (the same
characters are used in the <a href="map_screen.html">dungeon map</a> and in the
leftmost column of the inventory list) to view a partial inventory which only
contains objects of that class. If you hear a beep instead of getting the
inventory, this means that you don't have any object of that class. (Some
terminals can't produce the beep; in this case, you don't get any effect.)</p>

<p>When you view the inventory list, you can enter the lowercase letter to
select an object directly; you can also press &lt;Escape&gt; in order to get
back to the <a href="map_screen.html">map screen</a> first and enter the letter
(or do anything else) there.</p>
