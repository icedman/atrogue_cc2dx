<p>The dungeon of atrogue consists of several consecutive storeys; the current
storey number is shown in the <a
href="../map_screen.html#statistics">statistics line</a> on the map screen.
Storeys are connected by staircases; some staircases are "unidirectional", i.e.
they allow the player to go either down or up, not both; depending on gameplay
difficulty, some upward staircases may only appear when the player has the
Amulet. The player can enter a different storey by using a staircase; he can
also get to a deeper storey "accidentally" by falling down a trapdoor or get to
a higher storey by applying the Amulet.</p>

<p>Each storey consists of one or more independent rectangular sections (maps).
The sections within one storey aren't directly connected; the player can get
from one to the other via special "magic" doorways or by teleporting or
applying an object or other tricks.</p>

<p>Each section is created "just in time" (i.e. not in advance, but only when
the player character is about to enter it for the first time) and usually in
the following steps:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>The available space of a section is divided into <b>rectangles</b> of
random position, width and height. (This algorithm is some kind of "architect
component".)</li>
<li>When it's known how many rectangles fit into the section altogether, the
next step is to decide how many of them should become <b>rooms</b> or
<b>mazes</b> or simply remain <b>empty space</b>, respectively.</li>
<li>The rooms and mazes are dug out of the "solid rock" and connected with each
other by <b>tunnels</b>.</li>
<li>Finally, the section gets some <b>stairs</b> to the next storey and is
populated with <b>creatures</b> and <b>objects</b> etc.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Once a section has been created, it is kept in memory; it isn't "forgotten"
or randomly re-created each time the player leaves and revisits it. The only
exception are sections which are explicitly marked as "volatile" (section flag
secfVolatile); this is intended for higher gameplay difficulties, e.g. to
create a seemingly infinite dungeon department.</p>

<p>The dungeon is generally split into disjunct <i>departments</i>: vertical
sequences of sections which span a range of storeys. Sections for different
departments can be on the same storey. The "main" department of the dungeon is
called "Deep Dungeon"; it consists of a sequence of sections which lead
straight downward, like in the original Rogue games. Some sections of the main
department are "branching": they contain more than one downward staircase or a
special connection to another section on the current storey, leading to
different departments. Among the possible other department kinds are mines and
underground towns; each kind can have a specific section layout, not
necessarily the "rooms and tunnels" layout of the main department.</p>
