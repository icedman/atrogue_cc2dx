<p>atrogue is a turn-based game and therefore doesn't use a concept of
"continuous time" like in the real universe. Instead, each turn is equivalent
to the passing of one "dungeon clock tick" by default. These ticks are shown in
the <a href="../map_screen.html#statistics">statistics line</a> on the map
screen.</p>

<p>Versions before 0.3.0 only allowed everything to proceed at a speed of one
step (action) per tick. The sole exception was that hasted creatures could act
twice per tick and slowed creatures every other tick. This was too unflexible
for some desirable features and for a better gameplay experience.</p>

<p>In newer versions, the game can divide every dungeon clock tick into 1000
"milliticks". This allows creatures to act at wildly different speeds. It also
allows dungeon-related events and effects to proceed at the speed which makes
the most sense considering the detailed preferences (esp. difficulty) and
circumstances like kind of effect and storey number.</p>
