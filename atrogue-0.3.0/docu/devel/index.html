<p><a name="warning"></a><b>Spoiler Warning</b></p>

<p>This part of the documentation is only intended for game developers. It
contains quite detailed information about the internals of atrogue. Since one
of the goals of playing atrogue is to discover all the things that might happen
and to find out how it works on your own, reading this documentation spoils
your joy of playing atrogue!</p>

<p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Okay, it seems you're still reading in spite of the above warning. :-) So
let's see what parts of atrogue development are already documented. atrogue is
completely written in C. This HTML documentation currently only provides a
short overview, but recently a wizard told me that the source code contains
some nice documentation. :-) Thus, if you need more details about how something
works, have a look at the source...</p>

<p>If you haven't yet read the <i>user</i> documentation or played atrogue
extensively, you should do that now first. This part of the documentation
presupposes that.</p>
