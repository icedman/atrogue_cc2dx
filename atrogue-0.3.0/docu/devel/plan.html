Developers<br><font size="+1">Plans for Future Versions</font></b></center>

<p>Several interesting features have not yet been implemented. However, the
current development focus shall not be on featuritis, but rather on fixing all
bugs which appear and on correcting any game design mistakes before building
more code on top of that, making it even worse.</p>

<p>This page only lists some very general/global feature ideas. Tons of little
ideas are documented within the source code with "IMPLEMENTME" marks (cf. the
<a href="coding_style.html">coding style</a> documentation).</p>

<p><ul>
<li><b>Finetuning:</b> pretty much anything in atrogue depends on chance; but
some of the probabilities (and aging amounts BTW) surely need some finetuning,
e.g. should be higher or lower or depend more (or less) on gameplay difficulty,
storey number etc.</li>
<li><b>Shops:</b> could implement special "shop sections" where the player can
buy objects, paying with gold found during the game.</li>
<li><b>Other special sections:</b> could implement "bonus/malus" sections where
the player can pick enchanted objects or has to fight against nasty creatures
or "structural issues" of the section (flood; shrinking room). Such sections
could appear e.g. when the player applies the AoY.</li>
<li><b>Number of lives:</b> the player character can already be reborn; but
maybe some players would like to get more lives, e.g. using a command-line
option; rather allow the player to increase the number with in-game activities,
maybe a special scroll or potion or a special trick with a stone table obstacle
or quarks.</li>
<li><b>Demo Mode:</b> the demo mode shall allow the player to sit back and
watch the game playing automatically. Minimal code is already there, but
implementing good heuristics for an <i>interesting</i> automatic gameplay will
be hard, and this shouldn't begin before all other relevant features are
implemented - otherwise the heuristics become wrong.</li>
<li><b>Remote Mode:</b> this is a rather crude idea about external programs
which could start atrogue remotely, rerouting the standard input/output and
faking a human player. Think of it as some kind of "external demo mode". Very
low on my to-do list...</li>
