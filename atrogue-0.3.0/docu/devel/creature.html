<p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Many creatures populate the dungeon. The number and kinds of creatures
depend on the respective storey, their number also depends on gameplay
difficulty and dungeon section size and other preferences. We don't call them
"monsters" in this game because that notion might imply something negative and
some creatures can be friends of the player character...</p>

<p><a name="data"></a><b>Internal Creature Data</b></p>

<p>Internally, creatures are represented by C data structures. Every creature
structure contains the following information:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>creature class (e.g. bat, kestrel)</li>
<li>flags (properties, abilities)</li>
<li>current coordinates (only valid if the "cfDead" flag isn't set)</li>
<li>target coordinates (where the creature tries to move)</li>
<li>current room number (related to current coordinates)</li>
<li>health, strength, experience, direction of last move</li>
<li>timers for blindness, confusion, hallucination, slowed/hasted, sleep,
levitation, being held and being frozen (decremented once per dungeon clock
tick)</li>
<li>a pointer to the list of objects the creature is carrying</li>
<li>aggressivity (increases when the creature is hit, decreases when the
creature sleeps)</li>
<li>a "normal" ASCII character for map display</li>
<li>a "disguising" ASCII character for map display (used for sleeping,
object-imitating creatures)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="player"></a><b>The Player Character</b></p>

<p>The player character is basically a creature like all the others and thus is
represented by one instance of the C data structure explained above. However,
the game has to maintain some more information, e.g. for proper message,
inventory and map handling. This information is kept in a separate structure
tRogueData, declared in the source code file creature.h.</p>

<p><a name="act"></a><b>Activities of Creatures</b></p>

<p>Creatures can act at different speeds, not merely once per dungeon clock
tick. To enable a fine-grained speed of activities, the game uses <a
href="tick.html">milliticks</a>.</p>

<p>Sleeping and frozen creatures don't act at all. As a rule of thumb, other
creatures act once per tick by default, hasted creatures act nearly twice as
often, slowed ones only every other tick. The exact speed depends on various
details. Especially, the speed of the player character depends on the chosen
role preference and on the weight of the current inventory.</p>
